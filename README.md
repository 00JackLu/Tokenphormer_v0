## Usage

You can run each command in "commands.txt".

You could change the hyper-parameters of NAGphormer if necessary.

Due to the space limitation, we only provide several small datasets in the "dataset" folder.

For small-scale datasets, you can download them from https://docs.dgl.ai/tutorials/blitz/index.html.

For large-scale datasets, you can download them from https://github.com/wzfhaha/GRAND-plus.
